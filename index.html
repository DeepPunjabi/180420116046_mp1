  <h2>About Country</h2>
  <p>India is a beautiful country which is known for its different culture and tradition. It is famous for its historical heritage and monuments. The citizens here are very humble and dazzled by nature. Under British rule, it was a slave country before 1947. However, due to the struggle and dedication of our great freedom fighters, India got independence from British in 1947. When India got independence, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of India and hoisted the Indian flag and said "when the world sleeps, India will wake up for life and freedom".

    India is a democratic country where the people of the country have the right to make decisions for the betterment of the country. India is a famous country for this statement "Unity in diversity" because people of different caste, religion, culture and tradition live together in unity. Most Indian monuments and heritage sites are connected to the World Heritage site.</p></section>
